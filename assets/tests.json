      "One question had a table of function values, derivative values, double derivative values, etc. and then you were given an expression in the terms of those functions. You had to first find the derivative symbolically using various rules (i.e. quotient rule, power rule, and chain rule) and then plug in the values from the table into your derivative to evaluate each expression.",
      "Another question made you find the point on the function where IROC = AROC. This isn’t officially taught in AB Calc, but in BC it’s known as the mean value theorem (MVT). Essentially, you first have to use the quotient, power, and chain rules to find the derivative of a function. Then, you have to set that derivative expression equal to the AROC (which is simply Δy/Δx: they’ll give you two x-values and you’ll have to find the y-values by plugging those x-values into the original function) and solve for the x-values that make AROC (which is Δy/Δx) = IROC (which is your derivative). If you get multiple x-values, you’ll have to make sure to use the one that is in the domain they give you (i.e. in between the two x-values you used to find the AROC). So yeah, essentially, you’re f**ked."

Some questions were trippy (e.g. 22 was “formal operational” or some bullsh*t like that… Perkins said it wasn’t going to be included in your grade anyways), but other than that, it wasn’t that bad. You do have to know some names though (e.g. Pavlov, etc).

It had a hint that you had to have 8 definitions, and I’m just realizing now that that probably meant I should have individually defined US (unconditioned stimulus), UR (unconditioned response), CS (conditioned stimulus), and CR (conditioned response). Oh well… you can make sure to define them and do better than I did.",

Audrey’s friend, Roxy, observed that behavior and then went home and tried it with her own mother, Malificient (Roxy used observational learning after seeing Roxy’s modeled behavior being rewarded). Malificient, however, didn’t give Roxy candy and thus Roxy’s learned behavior went extinct (after not being reinforced).",
      "Audrey’s mother, Benificient, was classically conditioned to feel anxiety whenever seeing her daughter, Audrey. Audrey’s temper tantrums served as the US (unconditioned stimulus) which evoked anxiety in Benificient—the UR (unconditioned response). After many times of seeing Audrey (originally the neutral stimulus) and then having her throw a tantrum (the unconditioned stimulus), Benificient learned to associate seeing Audrey with her temper tantrums. Thus, whenever she saw Audrey (now the conditioned stimulus), Benificient felt anxiety (now the conditioned response)."
